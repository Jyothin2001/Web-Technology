        <p class="paragraph">Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit, and millions already have.

            Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by presenting information on all branches of knowledge. <br>Hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, it consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous links to guide readers to more information.
            
            Written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers, known as Wikipedians, Wikipedia articles can be edited by anyone and anywhere with Internet access (and who is not presently blocked), except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism. </p>
